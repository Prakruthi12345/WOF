 A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT WE'RE HAPPY TONIGHT
 A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT WERE HAPPY TO NIGHT
 A CHANGE WOULD DO YOU GOOD
 A DREAM IS A WISH YOUR HEART MAKES
 A KISS IS STILL A KISS
 A KNOT HER ONE BITES THE DUST
 A PARTRIDGE IN A PEAR TREE
 A REAL LIVE NEPHEW OF MY UNCLE SAM
 A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR HELPS THE MEDICINE GO DOWN
 A YANKEE DOODLE DO OR DIE
 A YOU'RE ADORABLE B YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL
 ABOVE THE FRUITED PLAIN
 ABOVE THE FRUITED PLAIN!
 ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM
 AGAINST ALL ODDS
 AIN'T NO MOUNTAIN HIGH ENOUGH
 ALL I NEED IS A MIRACLE
 ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS MY TWO FRONT TEETH
 ALL MY BAGS ARE PACKED I'M READY TO GO
 ALL THE LEAVES ARE BROWN AND THE SKY IS GRAY
 ALL THINGS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL
 ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED
 AND A PARTRIDGE IN A PEAR TREE
 AND FOLKS DRESSED UP LIKE ESKIMOS
 AND I WON'T QUIT TILL I'M A STAR ON BROADWAY
 AND I'M CRAZY FOR LOVING YOU
 AND IF YOU EVER SAW IT YOU WOULD EVEN SAY IT GLOWS
 AND MAY ALL YOUR CHRISTMASES BE WHITE
 AND SHE'S BUYING A STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN
 AND THE SKIES ARE NOT CLOUDY ALL DAY
 AND THEY CALLED IT PUPPY LOVE
 AND THEY NEVER GIVE YOU CREDIT
 AND THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE
 AND WHEN WE GET BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
